\chapter{Applying Newton's Laws}
\label{chap:ApplyingNewtonsLaws}
In this chapter, we take a closer look at how to use Newton's Laws to build models to describe motion. Whereas the previous chapter was focused on identifying the forces that are acting on an object, this chapter focuses on using those forces to describe the motion of the object.

Newton's Laws are meant to describe ``point particles'', that is, objects that can be thought of as a point and thus have no orientation. A block sliding down a hill, a person on a merry-go-round, a bird flying through the air can all be modelled as point particles, as long as we do not need to model their orientation. In all these cases, we can model the forces on the object using a free-body diagram as the location of where the forces are applied on the object do not matter. In a later chapter, we will introduce the tools required to apply Newton's Second Law to objects that can rotate, where we will see that the location of where a force is exerted is important.

\section{Statics}
When using Newton's Laws to model an object, one can identify two broad categories of situations: static and dynamic. In static situations, the acceleration of the object is zero. By Newton's Second Law, this means that the vector sum of the forces (and torques, as we will see in a later chapter) exerted on an object must be zero. In dynamic situations, the acceleration of the object is non-zero. 

For static problems, since the acceleration vector is zero, we can choose a coordinate system in a way that results in as many forces as possible being aligned with the axes (so that we minimize the number of forces that we need to break up into components).

\begin{example}{You push horizontally with a force $\vec F$ on a box of mass $m$ that is resting against a vertical wall, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockwall}. The coefficient of static friction between the wall and the box is $\mu_s$. What is the minimum magnitude of the force that you must exert for the box to remain stationary?}
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockwall.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockwall} A horizontal force exerted on box that is resting against a wall.}

Since the acceleration of the box is zero, the vector sum of the forces exerted on the box is zero. We start by identifying the forces exerted on the box; these are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec F$, the horizontal force that you exert on the box.
\item $\vec F_g$, the weight of the box, with magnitude $mg$.
\item $\vec N$, a normal force exerted by the wall on the box. The force is in the horizontal direction, in the opposite direction to $\vec F$.
\item $\vec f_s$, a vertical force of static friction between the wall and the box. The force points upwards as the ``impeding motion'' of the block is downwards. The force will have at most a magnitude of $f_s\leq\mu_s N$, since the force of static friction depends on the other forces exerted on the object.
\end{enumerate}
The forces are shown in the free-body diagram in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockwall_fbd}, along with our choice of coordinate system which was chosen so that all forces are either in the $x$ or $y$ direction. 
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockwall_fbd.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockwall_fbd} Free-body diagram of the forces exerted on the box.}
The $x$ component of Newton's Second Law is:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x = F - N &=0\\
\therefore N = F
\end{align*}
which tells us that the normal force exerted by the wall has the same magnitude as the applied force, $\vec F$. The $y$ component of Newton's Second Law is:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_y = f_s - F_g &=0\\
\therefore f_s -mg &=0\\
\therefore f_s = mg\\
\end{align*}
which tells us that the force of friction must have the same magnitude as the weight. This makes sense, since they are the only forces with components in the $y$ direction, and must thus cancel each other out. 

The force of friction will be less than or equal to $\mu_sN$, and thus less than or equal to $\mu_s F$, since $\vec F$ and $\vec N$ have the same magnitude (from the $x$ component of Newton's Second Law). Furthermore, since $f_s=mg$, we can write:
\begin{align*}
f_s &\leq \mu_s F\\
\therefore mg &\leq \mu_s F\\
\therefore \frac{mg}{\mu_s} &\leq F
\end{align*}
which gives us the condition that $F\geq mg/\mu_s$, and thus the minimum magnitude of $F$ in order to keep the box from sliding down.

Although we used the lesser than or equal sign in the above equations, we could have used an equal sign if we were confident that the force of friction has its maximal magnitude, $f_s=\mu_sN$. The maximal magnitude of the force of friction is proportional to the force that we exert (since $N=F$); if we want to exert the least amount of force $F$, then we need the force of friction to be equal to its maximal magnitude which needs to be equal to the weight of the box. 

\textbf{Discussion:} This model makes sense because:
\begin{itemize}
\item The dimension of $mg/\mu_s$ is force.
\item If the mass of the box is increased, then one needs to push harder against the box to keep it up.
\item If the coefficient of static friction, $\mu_s$, is increased, one does not need to push as hard. 
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

TODO: A student's thought of how to use the force of static friction, in particular about when to set it equal to $\mu_sN$ instead of less than. Perhaps this would belong in chapter 5, when the forces of friction are discussed?



\section{Linear motion}
We can describe the motion of an object whose \textit{velocity vector does continuously change direction} as ``linear'' motion. For example, an object that moves along a straight line in a particular direction, then abruptly changes direction and continues to move in a straight line can be modelled as undergoing linear motion over two different segments (which we would model individually). An object moving around a circle, with its velocity vector continuously changing direction, would not be considered as undergoing linear motion. Example paths of objects undergoing linear and non-linear motion are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:linearmotion}.
\capfig{0.3\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/linearmotion.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:linearmotion} (Left:) Displacement vectors for an object undergoing three segments that can each be modelled as linear motion. (Right:) Path of an object whose velocity vector changes continuously and cannot be considered as linear motion.}

When an object undergoes linear motion, we always model the motion of the object over straight segments separately. Over one such segment, the acceleration vector will be co-linear with the displacement vector of the object (parallel or anti-parallel - note that the acceleration can change direction as it would from a spring force, but will always be co-linear with the displacement).

\begin{example}{A block of mass $m$ is placed at rest on an incline that makes an angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockI}. The block is nudged slightly so that the force of static friction is overcome and the block starts to accelerate down the incline. At the bottom of the incline, the block slides on a horizontal surface. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is $\mu_{k1}$, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and horizontal surface is $\mu_{k2}$. If one assumes that the block started at rest a distance $L$ from the horizontal surface, how far along the horizontal surface will the block slide before stopping?}

\capfig{0.5\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockI.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockI} A block slides down an incline before sliding on a flat surface and stopping. }

We can identify that this is linear motion that we can break up into two segments: (1) the motion down the incline, and (2), the motion along the horizontal surface. We will thus identify the forces, draw the free-body diagram for the block, and use Newton's Second Law twice, once for each segment.

It is often useful to describe the motion in words to help us identify the steps required in building a model for the block. In this case we could say that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The block slides down the incline and accelerates in the direction of motion. By identifying the forces and applying Newton's Second Law, we can determine its acceleration which will be parallel to the incline.
\item The block will reach a certain speed at the bottom of the incline, which we can determine from kinematics by knowing that the block travelled a distance $L$, with a known acceleration and that it started at rest.
\item The block will decelerate along the horizontal surface. Again, by identifying the forces and using Newton's Second Law, we will be able to determine the acceleration of the block.
\item The block will stop after having travelled an unknown distance, which we can find by using kinematics and knowing the acceleration of the block as well as its initial velocity at the bottom of the incline.
\end{enumerate}

Our first step is thus to identify the forces on the block while it is on the incline. These are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec F_{g}$, its weight.
\item $\vec N_1$, a normal force exerted by the incline.
\item $\vec f_{k1}$, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the incline. The force is opposite of the direction of motion, and has a magnitude given by $f_{k1}=\mu_{k1}N_1$.
\end{enumerate}
These are shown on the free-body diagram in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockI_fbd1}. As usual, we drew the acceleration, $\vec a_1$, on the free-body diagram, and chose the direction of the $x$ axis to be parallel to the acceleration. 

\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockI_fbd1.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockI_fbd1} Free-body diagram for the block when it is on the incline.}

Writing out the $x$ component of Newton's Second Law, and using the fact that the acceleration is in the $x$ direction ($\vec a=a_1\hat x$):
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x = F_g\sin\theta - f_{k1} &= ma_1\\
\therefore mg\sin\theta - \mu_{k1} N_1 &= ma_1
\end{align*}
where we expressed the magnitude of the kinetic force of friction in terms of the normal force exerted by the plane, and the weight in terms of the mass and gravitational field, $g$. The $y$ component of Newton's Second Law can be written:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_y = N_1-F_g\cos\theta &= 0\\
\therefore N_1 = mg\cos\theta
\end{align*}
which we used to express the normal force in terms of the weight. We can use this expression for the normal force by substituting it into equation we obtained from the $x$ component to find the acceleration along the incline:
\begin{align*}
mg\sin\theta - \mu_{k1} N_1 &= ma_1\\
mg\sin\theta - \mu_{k1} mg\cos\theta&= ma_1\\
\therefore a_1 &= g(\sin\theta-\mu_{k1}\cos\theta)
\end{align*}
Now that we know the acceleration down the incline, we can easily find the velocity at the bottom of the incline using kinematics. We choose the origin of the $x$ axis to be zero where the block started ($x_0=0$), so that the block is at position $x=L$ at the bottom of the incline. Using kinematics, we can find the speed, $v$, given that the initial speed, $v_0=0$:
\begin{align*}
v^2-v_0^2&=2a_1(x-x_0)\\
v^2&=2a_1L\\
\therefore v &= \sqrt{2a_1L}\\
&=\sqrt{2Lg(\sin\theta-\mu_{k1}\cos\theta)}
\end{align*}
We can now proceed to build a model for the second segment. We first identify the forces on the block when it is on the horizontal surface; these are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec F_{g1}$, its weight.
\item $\vec N_2$, a normal force exerted by the horizontal surface. This is in general different than the normal force exerted when the block was on the inclined plane. 
\item $\vec f_{k2}$, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the horizontal surface. The force is opposite of the direction of motion, and has a magnitude given by $f_{k2}=\mu_{k2}N_2$.
\end{enumerate}
The forces are illustrated by the free-body diagram in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockI_fbd2}, where we showed the acceleration vector, $\vec a_2$, which we determined to be to the left since the block is decelerating. We also chose an $xy$ coordinate system such that the $x$ axis is anti-parallel to the acceleration, so that the motion is in the positive $x$ direction (and the acceleration in the negative $x$ direction).

\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockI_fbd2.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockI_fbd2} Free-body diagram for the block when it is sliding along the horizontal surface. We (arbitrarily) chose the positive $x$ direction to be in the direction of motion and anti-parallel to the acceleration. We could easily have chosen the opposite direction.}

Writing out the $x$ component of Newton's Second Law:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x = -f_{k2} &= -ma_2\\
\therefore \mu_{k2}N_2 &= ma_2
\end{align*}
where we expressed the force of kinetic friction using the normal force. We  have to be careful here with the sign of the acceleration; the equation that we wrote implies that $a_2$ is a positive number, since $\mu_{k2}$ is positive and $N_2$ is also positive (it is the magnitude of the normal force). $a_2$ is the magnitude of the acceleration, and we included the fact that the acceleration points in the negative $x$ direction when we put a negative sign in the first line. The $x$ component of the acceleration is $-a_2$, and the vector is given by $\vec a_2=-a_2\hat x$.

The $y$ component of Newton's Second Law will allow us to find the normal force:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_y = N_2 -F_g &=0\\
\therefore N_2 = mg
\end{align*}
which we can substitute back into the $x$ equation to find the acceleration along the horizontal surface:
\begin{align*}
ma_2 &=\mu_{k2}N_2 \\
\therefore a_2&=\mu_{k2}g
\end{align*}
Now that we have found the acceleration along the horizontal surface, we can use kinematics to find the distance that the block travelled before stopping. We choose the origin of the $x$ axis to be the bottom of the incline ($x_0=0$), the acceleration is negative $a_x = -a_2 = -mu_{k2}g$, the final speed is zero, $v=0$, and the initial speed, $v_0$ is given by our model for the first segment. Using one of the kinematic equations:
\begin{align*}
v^2-v_0^2&=2(-a_2)(x-x_0)\\
v_0^2&=2a_2x\\
\therefore x &=\frac{1}{2a_2}v_0^2\\
&=\frac{1}{2\mu_{k2}g}2Lg(\sin\theta-\mu_{k1}\cos\theta)\\
\therefore x&=\frac{(\sin\theta-\mu_{k1}\cos\theta)}{\mu_{k2}}L
\end{align*}
\textbf{Discussion:} The result makes sense because:
\begin{itemize}
\item All of the terms in the fraction are dimensionless, so the value of $x$ will have the same dimension as $L$. 
\item If we make $L$ bigger, then $x$ will be bigger (if we release the block from higher up on the incline, it will have more time to accelerate and will slide further before stopping).
\item If we make $\mu_{k1}$ bigger, then $x$ will be smaller: if we increase friction on the incline, the block will have a smaller acceleration and smaller speed at the bottom.
\item If we increase the friction with the horizontal plane (increase $\mu_{k2}$), then $x$ will be reduced (it won't slide as far if there is more friction on the horizontal plane).
\item If we increase $\theta$, the numerator will be larger, so $x$ will increase (the block will accelerate more down a steeper incline and end up further).
\end{itemize} 

TODO: Make this into a problem, but give the stopping distance and ask for $L$!

\end{example}


\subsection{Modelling situations where forces change magnitude}
So far, the models that we have considered involved forces that remained constant in magnitude. In many cases, the forces exerted on an object can change magnitude and direction. For example, the force exerted by a spring changes as the spring changes length or the force of drag changes as the object changes speed. In these case, even if the object undergoes linear motion, we need to break up the motion into many small segments over which we can assume that the forces are constant. If the forces change continuously, we will need to break up the motion into an infinite number of segments and use calculus.

Consider the block of mass $m$ that is shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockvaryingforce}, which is sliding along a frictionless horizontal surface and has a  horizontal force $\vec F(x)$ exerted on it. The force has a different magnitude in the three segments of length $\Delta x$ that are shown. If the block starts at the origin of the $x$ axis with speed $v_0$, we can find, for example, its speed at position $x_3=3\Delta x$, after the block travelled through the three segments.

\capfig{0.7\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockvaryingforce.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockvaryingforce} A block being pushed along a frictionless horizontal surface with a force that changes.}

The horizontal force, $\vec F$, exerted on the block can be written as:
\begin{align*}
  \vec F (x)=
  \begin{cases}
    F_1\hat x & x<\Delta x \quad \text{(segment 1)}\\
    F_2\hat x & \Delta x \leq x< 2\Delta x \quad \text{(segment 2)}\\
    F_3\hat x & 2\Delta x \leq x\quad \text{(segment 3)}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
as it depends on the location of the block. To find the speed of the block at the end of the third segment, we can model each segment separately. The forces exerted on the block are the same in each segment:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec F_g$, its weight, with magnitude $mg$.
\item $\vec N$, a normal force exerted by the ground.
\item $\vec F(x)$, an applied force that changes magnitude with position and is different in the three different segments.
\end{enumerate}
which are illustrated in the free-body diagram show in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockvaryingforce_fbd}.

\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockvaryingforce_fbd.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockvaryingforce_fbd} Free-body diagram for the block shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockvaryingforce}.}

Newton's Second Law can be used to determine the acceleration of the block for each of the three segments, since the forces are constant within one segment. For all three segments, the $y$ component of Newton's Second Law just tells us that the normal force exerted by the ground is equal in magnitude to the weight of the block. The $x$ component of Newton's Second Law gives the acceleration:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x = F_i = ma_i
\end{align*}
where we have used the index $i$ to indicate which segment the block is in ($i$ can be 1, 2 or 3). The acceleration of the block in segment $i$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
a_i = \frac{F_i}{m}
\end{align*}
If the speed of the block is $v_0$ at the beginning of segment 1 ($x=x_0$), we can find its speed at the end of segment 1 ($x=x_1$), $v_1$, using kinematics and the fact that the acceleration in segment 1 is $a_1$:
\begin{align*}
v_1^2-v_0^2 &= 2a_1(x_1 - x_0)\\
v_1^2 &=v_0^2+ 2a_1\Delta x\\
\therefore v_1^2 &=v_0^2+2\frac{F_1}{m}\Delta x
\end{align*}
We can now easily find the speed at the end of segment 2 ($x=x_2$), $v_2$, since we know the speed at the beginning of segment 2 ($x_1$,$v_1$) and the acceleration $a_2$:
\begin{align*}
v_2^2 -v_1^2 &= 2a_2(x_2 - x_1)\\
\therefore v_2^2 &= v_1^2 + 2a_2\Delta x\\
&=v_0^2+ 2\frac{F_1}{m}\Delta x + 2\frac{F_2}{m}\Delta x
\end{align*}
It is easy to show that the speed at the end of the third segment is:
\begin{align*}
v_3^2 = v_0^2+ 2\frac{F_1}{m}\Delta x + 2\frac{F_2}{m}\Delta x +2\frac{F_3}{m}\Delta x
\end{align*}
If there were $N$ segments, with the force being different in each segment, we could use the summation notation to write:
\begin{align*}
v_N^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \frac{F_i}{m}\Delta x
\end{align*}
Finally, if the magnitude of the force varied continuously as a function of $x$, $\vec F(x)$, we would model this by taking segments whose length, $\Delta x$, tends to zero (and we would need an infinite number of such segments). For example, if we wanted to know the speed of the object at position $x=X$ along the $x$ axis, with a force that was given by $\vec F(x)=F(x)\hat x$, if the object started at position $x_0$ with speed $v_0$, we would take the following limit:
\begin{align*}
v^2 = v_0^2 + \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} 2\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \frac{F(x)}{m}\Delta x
\end{align*}
where $\Delta x = \frac{X}{N}$ so that as $\Delta x\to 0$, $N\to\infty$. Of course, integrals are the exact tool that allow us to evaluate the sum in this limit:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} 2\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \frac{F_i}{m}\Delta x =2 \int_{x_0}^{X}\frac{F(x)}{m}dx 
\end{align*}
and the speed at position $x=X$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 \int_{x_0}^{X}\frac{F(x)}{m}dx 
\end{align*}
Naturally, we can find the above result starting directly from calculus. If the component of the (net) force in the $x$ direction is given by $F(x)$, then the  acceleration is given by $a(x) = \frac{F(x)}{m}$. The velocity is related to the acceleration:
\begin{align*}
a(x) &= \frac{dv}{dt}\\
\therefore dv &= a(x)dt\\
\end{align*}
We cannot simply integrate the last equation to find that $v=\int a(x)dt$ because the acceleration is given as a function of position, $a(x)$, and not a function of time, $t$. Thus, we cannot simply take the integral over $t$ and must instead ``change variables'' to take the integral over $x$. $x$ and $t$ are related through velocity:
\begin{align*}
v &= \frac{dx}{dt}\\
\therefore dt &= \frac{1}{v}dx
\end{align*}
We can thus write:
\begin{align*}
dv &= a(x)dt = a(x)\frac{1}{v}dx \\
\end{align*}
The equation above is called a ``separable differential equation'', which can also be written:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{1}{v}a(x)
\end{align*}
This is called a differential equation because it relates the derivative of a function (the derivative of $v$ with respect to $x$, on the left) to the function itself ($v$ appears on the right as well). The differential equation is ``separable'', because we can separate out all of the quantities that depend on $v$ and on $x$ on different sides of the equation:
\begin{align*}
vdv = a(x)dx
\end{align*} 
This last equation says that $vdv$ is equal to $a(x)dx$. Remember that $dx$ is the length of a very small segment in $x$, and that $dv$ is the change in velocity over that very small segment. Since the terms on the left and right are equal, if we sum (integrate) the quantity $vdv$ over many segments, that sum must be equal to the sum (integral) of the quantity $a(x)dx$ over the same segments. Let us choose those segment such that for the beginning of the first interval the position and speed are $x_0$ and $v_0$, respectively, and the position and speed at the end of the last segment are $X$ and $V$, respectively. We then must have that:
\begin{align*}
\int_{v_0}^{V}vdv&=\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\
 \frac{1}{2}V^2 - \frac{1}{2}v_0^2 &= \int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\
\therefore V^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\
\end{align*}
which is the same as we found earlier. If the acceleration is constant, we recover our formula from kinematics:
\begin{align*}
V^2 &= v_0^2+ 2\int_{x_0}^{X}adx\\
&=v_0^2+ 2a(X-x_0)\\
\therefore V^2- v_0^2 &= 2a(X-x_0)
\end{align*}

%Example with spring, example with drag and terminal velocity
\begin{example}{A block of mass $m$ can slide freely along a frictionless surface. A horizontal spring, with spring constant, $k$, is attached to a wall on one end, while the other end can move freely, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockspring}. A coordinate system is setup such that the $x$ axis is horizontal and the free end of the spring is at $x=0$ when the spring is at rest. The block is pushed against the spring so that the spring is compressed by a distance $D$. The block is then released. What speed will the block have when it leaves the spring?}

\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/blockspring.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:blockspring} A block is launched along a frictionless surface by compressing a spring by a distance $D$. The top panel shows the spring when at rest, and the bottom panel shows the spring compressed by a distance $D$ just before releasing the block.}
As you recall, the force exerted by a spring depends on the compression or extension of the spring and is given by Hooke's Law:
\begin{align*}
\vec F(x) = -kx\hat x
\end{align*}
where $x$ is the position of the free end of the spring and $x=0$ corresponds to the spring being at rest. In our case, when the edge of the block is located at $x_0=-D$ (the spring is compressed), the force is thus in the positive $x$ direction (since $x_0$ is a negative number). 

The forces on the block are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec F_g$, its weight, with magnitude $mg$.
\item $\vec N$, a normal force exerted by the ground.
\item $\vec F(x)$, the spring force.
\end{enumerate}
Since the block is not moving vertically, the magnitude of the normal force must equal the weight $N=mg$, since these are the only forces with components in the vertical direction. The $x$ component of Newton's Second Law gives us the acceleration of the block (which depends on $x$):
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x = -kx &= ma(x)\\
\therefore a(x)&=-\frac{k}{m}x
\end{align*}
Again, recall that if $x$ is negative, then the acceleration will be in the positive direction. Since this scenario is exactly the same that we described above in the text, namely a force that varies continuously with position, we can apply the formula that we found earlier for determining the velocity after a varying force has been applied from position $x=x_0$ to position $x=X$:
\begin{align*}
V^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx
\end{align*}
$V$ is the final speed that we would like to find, $v_0=0$ because the block starts at rest, and $x_0=-D$ is the starting position of the block. $X$ is the position along the $x$ axis where the block leaves the spring.

We have to think a little about what the value of $X$ should be: when the spring is compressed and the block accelerating, the spring is pushing the block in the positive $x$ direction. Once the block reaches $x=0$ the spring would want to pull the block backwards, but since it is not attached to the block, it stops exerting a force on the block at that point. The block thus leaves the spring at $x=0$, so that the final position is $X=0$. The speed of the block when it leaves the spring is thus:
\begin{align*}
V^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\
&= 0 + 2\int_{-D}^{0}a(x)dx\\
&= 2\int_{-D}^{0}-\frac{k}{m}xdx\\
&= 2\left[ - \frac{k}{m}\frac{1}{2}x^2\right]_{-D}^{0}\\
&= \frac{k}{m}D^2\\
\therefore V &= \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}D
\end{align*}
\textbf{Discussion:} This result makes sense because:
\begin{itemize}
\item The dimension for the expression for $V$ is correct (you should check this!).
\item If the spring is compressed more (bigger value of $D$), then the speed will be higher.
\item If the mass is bigger (more inertia), then the final speed will be lower.
\item If the spring is stiffer (bigger value of $k$), then the final speed will be higher.
\end{itemize}
If you have studied physics before, you may have realized that the speed is easily found by conservation of energy:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}mV^2=\frac{1}{2}kD^2
\end{align*}
which gives the same value for $V$. As we will see in a later chapter, kinetic and potential energy are defined as they are, precisely because it makes using conservation of energy equivalent to using forces as we just did.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{An object of mass $m$ is released from rest out of a helicopter. The drag (air-resistance) on the object can be modelled as having a magnitude given by $bv$, where $v$ is the speed of the object and $b$ is a constant of proportionality. How does the velocity of the object depend on time?}
\label{ex:applyingnewtonslaws:drag}
As the object falls through the air, the forces exerted on the object are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F_g$, its weight, with magnitude $mg$, exerted downwards.
\item $F_d$, the force of drag, with magnitude $bv$, exerted upwards. 
\end{enumerate}
Since the object will fall in a straight line, this is a one-dimensional problem, and we can choose the $x$ axis to be vertical, with positive $x$ pointing downwards, and the origin located where the object was released. The object will thus have a positive acceleration and move in the positive $x$ direction with this choice of coordinate system. This is illustrated in the free-body diagram in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:drag_fbd}.
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/drag_fbd.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:drag_fbd} Free-body diagram for a block free-falling with drag.}

Newton's Second Law for the object gives:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x = F_g - F_d &= ma\\
mg - bv &= -ma\\
\therefore a &= \left (g-\frac{b}{m} \right)
\end{align*}
In this case, the acceleration depends explicitly on velocity rather than position, as we had before. However, we can use the same methodology to find how the velocity changes with time. First, we can note that the acceleration is zero if:
\begin{align*}
g-\frac{b}{m}v &=0\\
\therefore v = \frac{mg}{b}
\end{align*}
That is, once the object reaches a speed of $v_{term}=mg/b$, it will stop accelerating, i.e. it will reach ``terminal velocity''. Note that this is the same condition as requiring that the drag force ($bv$) have the same magnitude as the weight ($mg$).

Writing the acceleration as $a=\frac{dv}{dt}$, we can write:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dv}{dt} &= \left(g-\frac{b}{m}v \right)
\end{align*}
which again, is a separable differential equation, in which we can write the terms that depend on $v$ and those that depend on $t$ on separate sides of the equal sign:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dv}{g-\frac{b}{m}v}&= dt\\
\frac{dv}{v-\frac{mg}{b}}&= -\frac{b}{m}dt\\
\end{align*}
where we re-arranged the equation in the second line so that it would be easier to integrate in the next step. We can find the velocity, $v(t)$, at some time, $t$, by stating that $v=0$ at $t=0$ and taking the integrals (sum) on both sides. Again, we are modelling the motion as being made up of a large number of very small segments where the quantities on both sides of the equation are the same. Thus, if we sum (integrate) those quantities over all of the same segments, the left and right hand side of the equations will still be equal to each other:
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{v(t)}\frac{dv}{v-\frac{mg}{b}} &= -\int_0^t\frac{b}{m} dt\\
\left[\ln\left(v-\frac{mg}{b} \right)\right]_0^{v(t)} &=-\frac{b}{m}t\\
\ln\left(v(t)-\frac{mg}{b} \right)-\ln\left(-\frac{mg}{b} \right)&=-\frac{b}{m}t\\
\ln\left( \frac{v(t)-\frac{mg}{b}}{-\frac{mg}{b}} \right)&=-\frac{b}{m}t\\
\end{align*}
where, in the last line, we used the property that $\ln(a)-\ln(b)=\ln(a/b)$. By taking the exponential on either side of the equation ($e^{\ln(x)}=x$), we can find an expression for the velocity as a function of time:
\begin{align*}
\frac{v(t)-\frac{mg}{b}}{-\frac{mg}{b}} &= e^{-\frac{b}{m}t}\\
v(t)-\frac{mg}{b} &= -\frac{mg}{b}e^{-\frac{b}{m}t}\\
\therefore v(t) &= \frac{mg}{b}-\frac{mg}{b}e^{-\frac{b}{m}t}\\
&=\frac{mg}{b}\left(1-e^{-\frac{b}{m}t}\right)
\end{align*}
\textbf{Discussion:} This equation tells us that the velocity increases as a function of time, but the rate of increase decreases exponentially with time. At time $t=0$, the velocity is zero, as expected. As $t$ approaches infinity, $v$ approaches, $\frac{mg}{b}$, which is the terminal velocity. The time dependence of the velocity is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:drag_vt}.

\capfig{0.7\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/drag_vt.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:drag_vt} Velocity as a function of time for an object of mass $m=\SI{10}{kg}$ which is free-falling from rest with a drag coefficient $b=\SI{0.5}{Ns/m}$.}

 
\end{example}

\section{Non-linear motion}
We can always sub-divide the motion of an object as being made of small straight segments in which we can apply Newton's Laws as we did in the previous sections. However, if the direction of the acceleration vector continuously changes, it becomes impractical to define a coordinate system that changes orientation for each segment; that is, in general, one cannot necessarily choose a coordinate system such that the acceleration is parallel to one of the axes. 

Consider for example the trajectory of an object that is released from an airplane that is flying in the horizontal direction, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:plane}. 
\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/plane.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:plane} An object dropped from a moving airplane.}
In the absence of a drag force, the motion of the object can be modelled independently in the horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) directions as linear motion.  The only force on the object is its weight (in the negative $y$ direction), so the two components of Newton's Second Law are:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x &= 0\\
\sum F_y &= -F_g = -mg = ma_y\\
\therefore \vec a &= a_y \hat y=-g\hat y
\end{align*}
With the acceleration ($a_y=-g$), the initial velocity of the object (which is horizontal, since it was released from the airplane) and the kinematic equations, the motion of the falling object is completely specified (parabolic motion). 

Consider instead the case of the object falling from the airplane with drag. In that case, there is a force of drag that points in the opposite direction of the velocity, as shown in the free-body diagram in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:plane_fbd}. The free-body diagram is drawn at some instant in time after the object was released and also shows the velocity vector of the object in order for the drag force to be drawn in the correct direction. 
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/plane_fbd.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:plane_fbd} Free-body diagram for an object falling with a force of drag, when the initial velocity of the object was horizontal. The velocity of the object is shown in this case so that the direction of the force of drag can be determined.}
Since the velocity depends on the acceleration, the acceleration depends on the force of drag, and the force of drag depends on the velocity, the acceleration vector will continuously change in both magnitude and direction. There is thus no straightforward choice of coordinate system that will make the acceleration colinear with one of the axes, so our best choice of a coordinate system is one where the most number of forces are colinear with the axes. If at some time $t$, the velocity vector makes an angle $\theta(t)$ with the horizontal (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:plane_fbd}), we can write the $x$ and $y$ components of Newton's Second Law to obtain the $x$ and $y$ components of the acceleration vector:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x &= -F_d\cos\theta = ma_x \\
\therefore a_x &= -\frac{1}{m}F_d\cos\theta\\
\sum F_y &= F_d\sin\theta-F_g = ma_y \\
\therefore a_y &= \frac{1}{m}F_d\sin\theta-g
\end{align*}
We can write the velocity vector as $\vec v(t) = (v_x(t), v_y(t))$, so that the magnitude of the velocity vector is $v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$. If we assume that drag is proportional to the speed of the object, we can write the drag force as $F_d = bv=b\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$. The cosine and sine of the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal are given by:
\begin{align*}
\cos\theta &= \frac{v_x}{\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}}\\
\sin\theta &= \frac{v_y}{\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}}\\
\end{align*}
We can then write the $x$ and $y$ components of the acceleration as:
\begin{align*}
a_x&=\frac{dv_x}{dt}=-\frac{1}{m}F_d\cos\theta=-\frac{1}{m}b\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}\frac{v_x}{\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}}=-\frac{b}{m}v_x\\
a_y&=\frac{dv_y}{dt}=\frac{1}{m}F_d\sin\theta-g=\frac{1}{m}b\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}\frac{v_y}{\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}}-g=\frac{b}{m}v_y-g\\
\end{align*}
which give us two independent\footnote{The differential equations are ``independent'' because the equation for, say, the $x$ component does not refer to any of the $y$ components. If the drag force were proportional to the speed squared (instead of the speed), the equations would not be independent.} separable differential equation for the $x$ and $y$ components of the speed as a function of time:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dv_x}{dt} &=-\frac{b}{m}v_x\\
\frac{dv_y}{dt} &= \frac{b}{m}v_y-g\\
\end{align*}
These can be solved in the same manner that we found the velocity as a function of time in Example \ref{ex:applyingnewtonslaws:drag}, except that we must now solve for the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity (independently). This is left as an exercise in the question library.

TODO: Make the above, including plotting the solutions ($v_x, v_y, v$), a question in the Question Library! Perhaps even to find when the object reaches a speed of 99\% of the terminal velocity. They should also find the terminal velocity (which will be vertical!).


\section{Uniform circular motion}
As we saw in Chapter \ref{chap:describingmotioninnd}, ``uniform circular motion'' is defined to be motion along a circle with constant speed. This may be a good time to review section \ref{sec:describingmotioninnd:circular} for the kinematics of motion along a circle. In particular, for the uniform circular motion of an object around a circle of radius $R$, you should recall that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The velocity vector, $\vec v$, is always tangent to the circle.
\item The acceleration vector, $\vec a$, is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, because the magnitude of the velocity vector does not change.
\item The acceleration vector, $\vec a$, always points towards the centre of the circle.
\item The acceleration vector has magnitude $a=v^2/R$.
\item The angular velocity, $\omega$, is related to the magnitude of the velocity vector by $v=\omega R$ and is constant.
\item The angular acceleration, $\alpha$, is zero for uniform circular motion, since the angular velocity does not change.
\end{itemize}
In particular, you should recall that even if the speed is constant, the acceleration vector is always non-zero in uniform circular motion because the \textbf{velocity changes direction}. According to Newton's Second Law, this implies that there \textbf{must be a net force on the object that is directed towards the centre of the circle} (parallel to the acceleration):
\begin{align*}
\sum \vec F = m\vec a
\end{align*} 
where the acceleration has a magnitude $a=v^2/R$. Because the acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle, we sometimes call it a ``radial'' acceleration (parallel to the radius), $a_R$, or a ``centripetal'' acceleration (directed towards the centre), $a_c$.

Consider an object in uniform circular motion in a horizontal plane on a frictionless surface, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH}.
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/circleH.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH} An object undergoing uniform circular motion on a frictionless surface, as seen from above.}
The only way for the object to undergo uniform circular motion as depicted is if the net force on the object is directed towards the centre of the circle. One way to have a force that is directed towards the centre of the circle is to attach a string between the center of the circle and the object, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH}. If the string is under tension, the force of tension will always be towards the centre of the circle. The forces on the object are thus:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec F_g$, its weight with magnitude $mg$.
\item $\vec N$, a normal forced exerted by the surface.
\item $\vec T$, a force of tension exerted by the string.
\end{enumerate}
The forces are depicted in the free-body diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH_fbd}, where we also drew the acceleration vector. Note that this free-body diagram is only ``valid'' at a particular instant in time since the acceleration vector continuously changes direction and would not always be lined up with the $x$ axis (unless the coordinate system also changes direction continuously). 
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/ApplyingNewtonsLaws/circleH_fbd.png}{\label{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH_fbd} Free-body diagram for the object from Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH_fbd} undergoing uniform circular motion.}
Writing out the $x$ and $y$ components of Newton's Second Law:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_x &= T = ma_R\\
\sum F_y &= N - F_g =0
\end{align*}
The $y$ component just tells us that the normal force must have the same magnitude as the weight because the object is not accelerating in the vertical direction. The $x$ component tells us the relation between the magnitudes of the tension in the string and the radial acceleration. Using the speed of the object, we can also write the relation between the tension and the speed:
\begin{align*}
T &= ma_R=m\frac{v^2}{R}\\
\end{align*}
Thus, we find that the tension is the string increases with the square of the speed, and decreases with the radius of the circle.

TODO: Checkpoint question about what happens to the motion of the block if the string breaks (images with different possible trajectories). 

\begin{example}{A car goes around a curve which can be approximated as the arc of a circle of radius $R$. The coefficient of static friction between the tires of the car and the road is $\mu_s$. What is the maximum speed with which the car can go around the curve without skidding?}

\end{example}

\begin{example}{A ball of mass $m$ is attached to a mass-less string and executing circular motion along a circle of radius $R$, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleV}. Can the speed of the block be constant? What is the minimum speed of the ball at the top of the circle?}
