\label{chapter:fluidmechanics}
In this chapter, we introduce the tools required to model the dynamics of fluids. This will allow us to model how objects can float, how water flows through a pipe, and how air plane wings create lift. We will start by introducing the concept of pressure and modelling static fluids (hydrostatics) before developing models for fluids that flow (hydrodynamics). Fluids are generally defined as the phase of matter in which atoms (or molecules) are only loosely bound to each other, such as in gases or liquids.

\section{Pressure}
The pressure exerted by a force, $F$, over an area, $A$, is a scalar quantity, $P$, defined as:
\begin{align*}
P=\frac{F}{A}
\end{align*}
The SI unit for pressure is the Pascal ($\si{Pa}$). Pressure is related to the area, $A$, over which a force is exerted, and can be thought of as a measure of how concentrated that force is. For example, a force of $\SI{10}{N}$ exerted through a needle (with a small area, $A$) will result in a much larger pressure than if that same force is exerted by a flat hand. 

Pressure is a useful concept for modelling fluids, as the pressure in a fluid can be used to model whether the fluid will move or not. When a force is exerted on a fluid, we can model the fluid as having pressure everywhere in the fluid. The pressure in a fluid results in a force that is exerted by the fluid on any element of the fluid in \textbf{all directions}. This is analogous to the tension that exists everywhere in a rope, where each element of the rope experiences forces that try to pull it apart. Pressure can be thought of as a ``negative'' tension, in that the material under pressure is trying to collapse on itself, rather than be pulled apart. In order to create a tension, one exerts a force on a rope that is outwards (trying to stretch the rope), so that the rope exerts an inwards force in reaction. In order to create pressure in a fluid, one must exert an inwards force on the fluid, which itself then exerts an outwards force, in reaction.

If we consider a small cubic volume of fluid, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure}, that element of fluid will experience forces in all directions from the pressure in the surrounding fluid. If there is no net force on the element of fluid because of the pressure, then we say that the fluid is in hydrostatic equilibrium, and the element of fluid will not accelerate.
\capfig{0.2\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/pressure.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure}A small element inside of a fluid will experience no net force from the pressure in the fluid, since the force from the pressure is exerted in all directions.}

Consider, instead, an element of fluid that is at the edge of a container with the fluid in it (e.g. a cup of water), as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_edge}.
\capfig{0.3\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/pressure_edge.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_edge}At the edge of a container, a small element of fluid will exert an outwards force on the container, and the container will exert an inwards force on the element of fluid.}
In this case, there is no fluid on the right hand side of the fluid element to exert a force towards the left. If the fluid element is in equilibrium, it must then be the container that exerts that force, $\vec F_{container}$ on the fluid. By Newton's Third Law, the element of fluid exerts an outwards force on the container. This is true at all points on the container, which will all experience an outwards force from the pressure of the fluid. The magnitude of the outwards force on each surface of the container will be equal to the pressure of the fluid multiplied by the area of that surface (it may need to be integrated, if the pressure is not constant over the surface). 

If you place an empty sealed tin can under water, the water will exert a pressure on all of the surfaces of the tin can that leads to a net inwards force on all surfaces of the tin can. If the water pressure is high enough, the tin can will get crushed. If, on the other hand, the tin can is allowed to fill with water, it will not get crushed, as the water inside the tin can will have the same pressure as the water outside the tin can and will exert an equal net outwards force on all surfaces of the tin can. The net force on each surface of the can will be zero, and the tin can will not get crushed, no matter how high the water pressure is. 

In general, if there is an interface with a fluid on either side at a different pressure, it is the \textbf{difference in pressure} on either side of the interface that determines the net force exerted on the interface, rather than the absolute pressure.

\begin{checkpoint}
\begin{MCquestion}{You use a pump to create a vacuum inside of a tin can and observe that the tin can gets crushed. Which explanation is correct?}
\item By sucking the air out of the can, you also suck in on the walls of the can.

\item You lower the pressure inside the can so that the air inside the can exerts a pulling force on the walls of the can.
\item All of the above. 
\end{MCquestion}
\end{checkpoint}

\subsection{The effect of gravity}
When discussing Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure}, we argued that the fluid exerts an equal force, from all directions, on the fluid element, so that the net force on the fluid element is zero. This is not quite correct in the presence of gravity, where the fluid element will have a weight. Thus, if the fluid element is to be in equilibrium, the upwards force (and pressure) from the fluid below must be higher than that from the fluid above the fluid element. 

Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_gravity} shows an element of fluid that has a height $h$ and a surface area $A$ in the horizontal direction. The pressure in the fluid must be higher below the fluid element if the element is to be in equilibrium.
\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/pressure_gravity.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_gravity}In the presence of gravity, the pressure below an element of fluid must be larger if the fluid element is to remain in equilibrium.}
The element of fluid has a total mass, $m$, given by:
\begin{align*}
m = \rho V = \rho Ah
\end{align*}
where $V=Ah$ is the volume of the fluid, and $\rho$, its density.

The net (horizontal) force exerted by the external fluid on the fluid element is zero along the vertical surfaces. Let $P_1$ be the pressure in the fluid above the fluid element, and $P_2$ be the pressure below the fluid element. If we choose a $y$ axis that is positive upwards and the fluid element does not accelerate in the vertical direction, then the $y$ component of Newton's Second Law, written for the fluid element, is:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_y = F_2 - F_1 -mg &= 0\\
P_2A - P_1A-mg &=0\\
P_2A - P_1A-\rho Ahg &=0\\
\therefore P_2 - P_1 = \rho gh
\end{align*}
where we used the fact that the force resulting from a pressure is given by the pressure multiplied by the area over which it is exerted. We thus find that the difference in pressure due to gravity in a fluid between two positions, $y_2$ and $y_1$, is given by:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:fluidmechanics:pgrav}
\Aboxed{P(y_2) - P(y_1) = -\rho g (y_2 - y_1)}
\end{align}
where the $y$ axis is defined to increase in the upwards direction. Since the pressure in the fluid increases as we move through the fluid, we say that there is a pressure gradient in the fluid.

We have assumed that the density of the fluid, $\rho$, is constant, and that the fluid cannot be compressed. This is a very good approximation for a liquid such as water, but not for a gas, whose density will depend on its pressure. If the fluid were a gas (e.g. a column of air in our atmosphere), both the density and the pressure will change as a function of height. We can easily take this into account into our model, if we consider the fluid element to have a very small heigh, $dy$, instead of the finite height, $h$, in the derivation above, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_gravity2}.
\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/pressure_gravity2.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_gravity2}Pressure gradient from gravity on an infinitesimal fluid element.}

 In the very small height, $dy$, the density of the fluid, $\rho$, can be taken to be constant, and the infinitesimal element of fluid will have a mass $dm$:
\begin{align*}
dm = \rho A dy
\end{align*}
We can model the pressure experted by the fluid above the fluid element as $P+dP$, and the pressure exerted by the fluid below as $P$, where $dP$ is a small (negative) change in pressure\footnote{We placed the $dP$ on the top part of the fluid, even though the pressure is higher on the bottom part of the fluid, because the $y$ axis increases upwards. We are really interested in the change in pressure, $dP$, that corresponds to a change in height along the positive $y$ direction, $dy$. }. The $y$ component of Newton's Second Law written for the infinitesimal fluid element is thus:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_y = PA - (P+dP)A -dm g &=0\\
PA -PA -dPA - \rho A dy g &=0\\
\therefore -dP -\rho gdy &=0
\end{align*}
We can thus determine how pressure changes with height, $y$:
\begin{align}
\Aboxed{\frac{dP}{dy} &= -\rho g}
\end{align}
This tells us that the rate of change of pressure with increasing $y$ is negative; in other words, the pressure decreases as the elevation increases, as we had already concluded. We can integrate the equation to obtain the change in pressure in going from $y_1$ to $y_2$:
\begin{align*}
dP &= -\rho g dy\\
\int_{P_1}^{P_2} dp&=-\int_{y_1}^{y_2}\rho gdy\\
\therefore P_2-P_1 &=-\int_{y_1}^{y_2}\rho gdy
\end{align*}
If the density, $\rho$, is constant, then this leads to Equation \ref{eq:fluidmechanics:pgrav}.

\begin{example}{If we assume that the density of air is proportional to its pressure, how does the density of air change with altitude?}
We know that the rate of change of pressure with altitude (position $y$, where positive $y$ is defined to be upwards) is given by:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dP}{dy} &= -\rho g
\end{align*}
Since we can assume that the density is proportional to the pressure, we can introduce an arbitrary constant, $a$, and state that:
\begin{align*}
\rho &=aP\\
\therefore \frac{dP}{dy} &=  \frac{1}{a}  \frac{d\rho}{dy}
\end{align*}
where the constant $a$ can be evaluated if we know the pressure and density at some point. We can thus write that the rate of change of the density with position $y$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
 \frac{1}{a} \frac{d\rho}{dy} &= -\rho g\\
 \therefore \frac{d\rho}{dy} &= -ag \rho
\end{align*}
This is a separable differential equation for $\rho$, allowing us to separate the variables and integrate from, say, an altitude of $y=0$ to an altitude $y$:
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\rho}{\rho} &= - ag dy\\
\int_{\rho_0}^{\rho}\frac{d\rho}{\rho} &= -\int_{0}^{y}agdy\\
\ln(\rho)-\ln(\rho_0)&= -agy\\
\ln\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_0} \right)&= -agy
\end{align*}
where $\rho_0$ is the density at $y=0$, and $\rho$, is the density at $y$. We can take the exponential on each side of the equation:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\rho}{\rho_0} &= e^{-agy}\\
\therefore \rho(y) &= \rho_0e^{-agy}
\end{align*}
We thus find that the density of the air decreases exponentially with altitude. This is why it is more difficult to breathe at high altitude. 

\textbf{Discussion:} Since we assumed that the density of the air is proportional to its pressure, then air pressure also decreases exponentially with increasing altitude. If we applied this model to the Earth's atmosphere, our model would only provide qualitative agreement, as the density of the air also depends on its temperature and other factors. Nonetheless, it is interesting that based on the simple requirement that an element of air be in hydrostatic equilibrium, we are able to obtain a reasonable description of how pressure and density change with altitude in the Earth's atmosphere.
\end{example}

\subsection{Pascal's Principle}
Pascal's Principle states that \textbf{if an external pressure is exerted on a fluid, the pressure everywhere in the fluid increases by that amount}. For example, if a fluid is contained in a piston with a cross-section area, $A$, and a force, $F$, is exerted on the piston, then the pressure in the whole fluid increase by $F/A$. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:piston}.
\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/piston.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:piston}A force exerted on the piston will increase the pressure everywhere in the fluid.}

If we want to determine the pressure in the water at some depth, $h$, in the ocean, we thus need to include the fact that the Earth's atmosphere exerts a net downwards force on the surface of the ocean as well as the change in pressure due to the weight of the water. The pressure from the air in the Earth's atmosphere is called ``atmospheric pressure'', and depends on a variety of conditions, such as the weather. The average pressure from the atmosphere is $P_0=\SI{1.013e5}{Pa}$. If the atmospheric pressure is $P_0$ at the surface of the ocean, then the pressure at some depth, $h$, is given by:
\begin{align*}
P(h) = P_0 + \rho g h
\end{align*}
where $\rho$ is the density of water. As a consequence, the pressure at any depth, $h$, in a fluid is always the same. 

\begin{example}{\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/lift.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:lift}A force exerted on the piston of a hydraulic lift in order to lift a mass $M$.}
A hydraulic lift exploits Pascal's principle in order to use a small force to exert a large force. The hydraulic lift in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:lift} shows a lift that is constructed by having a fluid between two vertical movable pistons. The piston are cylindrical and the diameter of their cross-sections are $D$ and $D/2$. A mass $M$ is placed on the piston with the larger diameter. What is the magnitude of the force, $\vec F$, that must be applied on the smaller piston in order to lift the mass $M$?}
If a force $\vec F$ is applied to the small piston, then the pressure in the fluid will increase by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta P = \frac{F}{A}=\frac{F}{\pi \frac{D^2}{4}}=\frac{4F}{\pi D^2}
\end{align*}
This will result in a net upwards force on the large piston, with a magnitude:
\begin{align*}
F' = \Delta P A' = \Delta P \pi D^2 = \frac{4F}{\pi D^2} \pi D^2 = 4F
\end{align*}
Thus the force on the large piston will be four times that exerted on the small piston. One only needs to exert a force of $Mg/4$ in order to lift the mass $M$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Measuring pressure}
In this section, we describe how one can design instruments to measure pressure. The most straightforward device is a manometer, which is constructed using a U-shaped tube filled with a fluid of known density, $\rho$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:manometer}.
{\capfig{0.45\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/manometer.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:manometer}A manometer can measure the difference between a pressure $P$ and atmospheric pressure, $P_0$. That difference is called ``gauge pressure''.}
A manometer can be used to measure a pressure $P$ relative to atmospheric pressure, $P_0$. One end of the tube is open to atmospheric pressure, and the other is connected to the fluid (e.g. a gas) for which we want to measure the pressure. If the pressure being measured is larger than atmospheric pressure, the fluid in the manometer will experience a greater downwards force on the side of the pressure to measured than the side open to atmospheric pressure, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:manometer}. There will be a difference, $h$, in the level of the fluid on each side of the tube, which is directly proportional to the difference in pressure on each side of the tube.

Consider the point in the fluid at location $B$ in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:manometer}, where the pressure is $P_B=P$. The point in the fluid at location $A$, which is at the same height in the fluid, must have the same pressure as point $B$. We can write the pressure at point $A$, $P_A$, as the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the pressure from the column of water of height, $h$:
\begin{align*}
P_A=P_0+\rho g h
\end{align*}
Since this must also be equal to the pressure at point $B$, we can find the difference between the pressure we want to measure and atmospheric pressure:
\begin{align*}
P_A &= P_B \\
P_0+\rho g h &= P\\
\therefore P - P_0 &= \rho g h 
\end{align*}
The difference of a pressure with atmospheric pressure is called ``gauge pressure'', and is all that we can measure if we do not know the value of the atmospheric pressure. Using a manometer, the gauge pressure is given by $\rho g h$, whereas the ``absolute pressure'', $P$, is given by adding the atmospheric pressure to the gauge pressure, $P = P_0 + \rho g h$. Most pressure measuring devices (``pressure gauges''), measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, using a similar mechanism.

The atmospheric pressure at a location on Earth varies based on the weather. A barometer is an instrument designed to measure atmospheric pressure. A simple barometer can be build from a manometer, with one end closed, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:barometer}.
{\capfig{0.3\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/barometer.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:barometer}A barometer constructed from a manometer to measure relative changes in atmospheric pressure.}
One end of the manometer is sealed on a day where the atmospheric pressure is, say, $P_0$, while the other end of the tube is left open. The height difference, $h$, between the fluid in either side of the tube is a measure of how different the current atmospheric pressure, $P_1$, is relative to the pressure $P_0$ when the manometer was sealed. In Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:barometer}, the barometer is shown on a day where the atmospheric pressure is lower than on the day the manometer was sealed. The difference in pressure is given by:
\begin{align*}
P_1 = P_0 + \rho g h
\end{align*}
if we define $h$ to be positive when the side with the pressure $P_0$ is higher (so $h$ is negative in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:barometer} and $P_1$ is less than $P_0$).

We can also measure the absolute atmospheric pressure if we evacuate the air out of the sealed end of the tube, so that $P_0=0$. When doing so, the difference in height between the fluid on either side of the manometer is a measure of the absolute atmospheric pressure.

\begin{example}{\capfig{0.3\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/barometer_abs.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:barometer_abs}A barometer constructed from a manometer to measure absolute atmospheric pressure.}Using a manometer filled with water ($\rho=\SI{1e3}{kg/m^3}$), you construct a barometer to measure the absolute atmospheric pressure by evacuating the air from one side of the manometer, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:barometer_abs}. What is the difference in height, $h$, when the atmospheric pressure is ``nominal'', $P_1=\SI{1.013e5}{Pa}$?}
The pressure, $P_1$, on the open side of the manometer is given by:
\begin{align*}
P_1=\rho g h
\end{align*}
if the sealed side of the manometer has a pressure of zero above the fluid. If $P_1=\SI{1.013e5}{Pa}$, we can find the height, $h$:
\begin{align*}
h=\frac{P_1}{\rho g}=\frac{(\SI{1.013e5}{Pa})}{(\SI{1000}{kg/m^3})(\SI{9.8}{m/s^2})}=\SI{10.3}{m}
\end{align*}
\textbf{Discussion: }The difference in height is about $\SI{10}{m}$ when the atmospheric pressure is nominal. This means that the manometer needs to be at least this tall to measure absolute atmospheric pressure, which is not practical to construct! If, instead, one uses a liquid with a higher density than that of water, then this height can be reduced substantially. Traditionally, barometers have been built using mercury, which has a density of ($\rho_{Hg}=\SI{13.6e3}{kg/m^3}$), so that the height difference at nominal atmospheric pressure is $\SI{760}{mm}$. This is a much easier instrument to build (apart from the safety concerns of using mercury). For this reason, an often used unit of pressure is ``mm of mercury'', which corresponds to the height difference in a manometer that is built using mercury. 
\end{example}

\section{Buoyancy}
In this section, we examine how the pressure in a fluid leads to a force of buoyancy on an object that is immersed in the fluid.
\capfig{0.7\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/buoyant.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:buoyant}(Left:) The weight of a fluid element is supported by the net upwards force from the pressure of the fluid below it. (Right:) If the fluid element is removed and replaced with an object, there will still be the same net upwards force from the pressure of the fluid, which is now exerted on the object.}
In the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:buoyant}, we show an element of fluid with a volume $V$. The weight of the element of fluid, $\vec F_g$, is supported by the net upwards force, $\vec F_B$, exerted by the pressure of the fluid surrounding the fluid element. The mass, $M$, of the element of fluid is given by:
\begin{align*}
M = \rho V
\end{align*} 
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid. The net force from the pressure, $F_B$, must thus have the same magnitude as the weight:
\begin{align*}
F_B = Mg = \rho V g
\end{align*}
Now, suppose that the fluid element is ``displaced'' and replaced by the hull of a boat, as shown in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:buoyant}. The net upwards force from the pressure of the fluid must remain the same, $F_B$, but that force is now exerted on the hull of the boat. We call that force the force of ``buoyancy'', which is the reason that a boat can float and the reason that you feel lighter when walking in a swimming pool. 

Thus, if an object displaces a volume, $V$, of a fluid with density $\rho$, when immersed in the fluid, that object will experience an upwards force of buoyancy, $\vec F_B$, with magnitude:
\begin{align}
\Aboxed{F_B = \rho V g}
\end{align} 
This ``principle'' was originally discovered by Archimedes, who stated that the force of buoyancy is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Note that we drew the fluid element at the surface of the fluid, but this is not required, and a force of buoyancy will be present if the object is completely immersed in the liquid. If you refer back to Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:pressure_gravity}, you will recall that the net upwards force on an element of fluid must be equal to its weight, even if the fluid element is completely immersed.

\begin{checkpoint}
\begin{MCquestion}{Does the force of buoyancy on a fully submerged object increase with the depth at which the object is submerged (ignoring any change from the varying value of $\vec g$)?}
\item Yes, because the force of buoyancy comes from the pressure in the fluid, which increases with depth. 
\item No, because the force of buoyancy comes from the difference in pressure above and below the object, which does not increase with depth. \correct
\end{MCquestion}
\end{checkpoint}

TODO: Question library question, how does pressure change with depth in a fluid if you take into account the fact that $g$ changes? (Need to use Gauss' Law, like the train-tunnel, assume uniform density of the Earth)

\begin{example}{You measure the weight of an object by suspending it with a spring scale. When you measure the weight of the object in air, you find that it has a weight $W_{a}$. When you measure the weight of the object when it is completely submerged in water, you find that it has a weight $W_w$. What is the density of the object?}
Given the weight of the object in air, we can easily determine its mass:
\begin{align*}
M = \frac{W_a}{g}
\end{align*}
However, since we do not know its volume, $V$, we can not directly determine its density. When the object is submerged in water, the measured weight will be the actual weight of the object (as measured in air) minus the magnitude of the force of buoyancy exerted by the water:
\begin{align*}
W_w &= W_a - \rho_w g V\\
\therefore V &= \frac{W_w -W_a}{\rho_w g}
\end{align*}
where $\rho_w$ is the density of water. Given the volume, we can now determine the object's density, $\rho$:
\begin{align*}
\rho = \frac{M}{V}=\frac{W_a\rho_w g}{g (W_w -W_a)}=\rho_w\frac{W_a}{W_w -W_a}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Discussion:} By using Archimedes' Principle, we were able to determine the volume, and thus the density of the object, by comparing measurements of its weight in air and in water. This is similar to the method that Archimedes came up with to determine if a crown owned by a general was made of real gold or if some of the gold has been replaced with an equal weight of silver. Archimedes supposedly went to the baths to ponder how to determine if the crown was made of gold, and had is Eureka moment when we he noticed the water level in the bath went up as went into the bath. He realized that denser gold would displace less water than silver for an equal weight. 
\end{example}

\section{Hydrodynamics}
In the previous sections we developed ``hydrostatic'' models for fluids when those fluids are at rest. In this section, we develop ``hydrodynamic'' models to discuss what happens when fluids flow. We will restrict most of our models to fluid that flow in a ``laminar'' fashion, rather than a ``turbulent'' fashion.

Laminar flow is the flow of a fluid when each particle in the fluid follows a path that can be represented by a line (a ``streamline''). Turbulent flow is the flow of a fluid where particles can follow rather complex paths, usually involving ``Eddy currents'' (little whirlpools). The two types of flow are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:turbulent}.
\capfig{0.7\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/turbulent.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:turbulent}Laminar (left) and turbulent (right) flow of a fluid around an object.}

\subsection{Continuity of flow}
Consider the laminar flow of a fluid through a pipe whose cross-sectional area narrows from $A_1$ to $A_2$ in the direction of flow, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:continuous}.
\capfig{0.6\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/continuous.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:continuous}Laminar flow of a fluid in a narrowing pipe.}
The particles that make up the fluid have a speed $v_1$ at the wide end of the pipe and speed $v_2$ at the narrow end. The \textbf{equation of continuity} is based on the premise that the fluid that enters the pipe must exit the pipe, as there is nowhere else for the fluid to go. That is, if during a period of time, $\Delta t$, a mass, $\Delta m$, of fluid enters the wide end of the pipe, then during that same period of time, the same mass of fluid must exit the narrow end of the pipe. 

During a period of time, $\Delta t$, the fluid at the wide end of the pipe will travel a distance $l_1=v_1\Delta t$. Thus, a volume of fluid, $\Delta V_1$, will enter the wide end of the pipe:
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_1 = A_1 l_1 = A_1 v_1 \Delta t
\end{align*}
Similarly, during that period of time, a volume $\Delta V_2$ will exit the narrow end of the pipe:
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_2 = A_2 l_2 = A_2 v_2 \Delta t
\end{align*}
If the fluid is compressible, its density can change. Let $\rho_1$ be the density of the fluid at the wide end of the pip and $\rho_2$ the density at the narrow end. The mass of fluid, $\Delta m$, entering the wide end of the pipe is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta m = \rho_1 \Delta V_1= \rho_1 A_1 v_1 \Delta t
\end{align*}
The mass of fluid exiting the narrow end of the pipe is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta m = \rho_2 \Delta V_2= \rho_2 A_2 v_2 \Delta t
\end{align*}
The mass of fluid entering the wide end of the pipe must equal the mass exiting the narrow end of the pipe:
\begin{align*}
\rho_1 A_1 v_1 \Delta t &= \rho_2 A_2 v_2 \Delta t
\end{align*}
Leading to the equation of continuity:
\begin{align}
\Aboxed{\rho_1 A_1 v_1 &= \rho_2 A_2 v_2}
\end{align}
The quantity $\rho A v$ has dimensions of mass per time, and corresponds to the mass of fluid passing through a cross section $A$ per unit time.

If the fluid is incompressible, as are most liquids, then the density is the same on both sides of the pipe, and the equation simplifies to:
\begin{align}
\Aboxed{A_1 v_1 &= A_2 v_2}\quad\text{(Incompressible fluid)}
\end{align}
For a liquid, we can define the ``volumetric flow'', $Q$, as:
\begin{align*}
Q=Av
\end{align*}
where $A$ is the cross-section through which a fluid with speed $v$ flows. $Q$ has the dimension of volume per time, and corresponds to the volume of fluid passing through the cross section $A$ per unit time. For an incompressible fluid, the equation of continuity is thus equivalent to stating the that volumetric flow, $Q$, of the fluid is a constant. 

\subsection{Bernoulli's Principle}
In this section we examine how the pressure and speed of a fluid change as a the fluid flows. We will restrict ourselves to discussing the flow of an \textbf{incompressible} fluid. Bernoulli was the first to quantitatively describe the flow of incompressible fluids, and we will show in this section how to derive ``Bernoulli's Principle''. 

Consider the laminar flow of an incompressible fluid through a pipe that changes height, from $y_1$ to $y_2$, as well as cross-sectional area, from $A_1$ to $A_2$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:bernoulli}. The figure shows an element of fluid, in blue, as it moves through the pipe. The top panel corresponds to the location of the fluid element at time $t=0$, whereas the bottom panel shows the location of the element of fluid at time $t=\Delta t$.

An element of fluid, in blue, is show a time $t=0$ (top panel), and then at a later time, $t=\Delta t$, (bottom panel).}

To model how the fluid moves through this pipe, we can use energy and the Work-Energy Theorem. We start by considering the amount of work done on the element of fluid as it moves from the position in the top panel to the position in the bottom panel. 

The fluid that is to the left of the element of fluid exerts a pressure, $P_1$, on the fluid element that leads to a net force, $\vec F_1$ towards the right. Similarly, the fluid to the right of the element of fluid, exerts a net force $\vec F_2$, in the opposite direction, due to the pressure $P_2$ on that side of the fluid element.

In a period of time, $\Delta t$, the left part of the fluid element will move a distance $l_1 = v_1 \Delta t$, while the the right part of the fluid element will move a distance $l_2=v_2\Delta t$. We can calculate the work done by each force, defining positive work to be in the direction of motion:
\begin{align*}
W_1 &= F_1l_1 = (P_1A_1)(v_1 \Delta t)\\
W_2 &= -F_2l_2 = -(P_2A_2)(v_2 \Delta t)
\end{align*}
Gravity will also do (negative) work on the fluid as it changes height. In a period of time $\Delta t$, a mass of fluid, $\Delta m$, will move from the position $y_1$ to the position $y_2$. The mass of fluid that changes height is given by the part of the fluid that moves a distance $l_1$ at the bottom of the pipe:
\begin{align*}
\Delta m = V_1 \rho = A_1 l_1 \rho = A_1 v_1 \Delta t \rho 
\end{align*}
Because of the equation of continuity, this is also equal to:
\begin{align*}
\Delta m = V_2 \rho = A_2 l_2 \rho = A_2 v_2 \Delta t \rho 
\end{align*}
since $A_1v_1 = A_2 v_2$. The force of gravity will thus do work:
\begin{align*}
W_g = -\Delta m g (y_2-y_1) = -(A_1 v_1 \Delta t \rho) g (y_2-y_1) 
\end{align*}
The net work done on the element of fluid over the time $\Delta t$ is thus:
\begin{align*}
W^{net} &= W_1+W_2+W_g = P_1A_1v_1 \Delta t - P_2A_2v_2 \Delta t -A_1 v_1 \Delta t \rho g (y_2-y_1) 
\end{align*}
Note that, because of the equation of continuity, $A_1v_1 = A_2 v_2$, we can factor out a $A_1v_1$ from each term:
\begin{align*}
W^{net} &=A_1v_1 \Delta t \Bigl(P_1- P_2 - \rho g (y_2-y_1)\Bigr) 
\end{align*}
The net work done on the fluid, must equal the change in kinetic energy, $\Delta K$, of the mass element, $\Delta m$, from one end of the pipe to the other:
\begin{align*}
\Delta K &= \frac{1}{2}\Delta m v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}\Delta m v_1^2\\
&=\frac{1}{2}( A_1 v_1 \Delta t \rho) (v_2^2 - v_1^2)
\end{align*}
Putting this altogether and using the Work-Energy Theorem, we have:
\begin{align*}
W^{net} &=\Delta K\\
A_1v_1 \Delta t \Bigl(P_1- P_2 - \rho g (y_2-y_1)\Bigr) &= \frac{1}{2}( A_1 v_1 \Delta t \rho) (v_2^2 - v_1^2)\\
P_1 - P_2 - \rho g (y_2-y_1)&= \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2
\end{align*}
We can re-arrange this so that all the quantities for each side of the pipe are on the same side of the equation:
\begin{align*}
P_1 +\frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2+ \rho g y_1= P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + \rho g y_2
\end{align*}
Since the locations $1$ and $2$ that we chose are arbitrary, we can state that, for laminar incompressible flow, the following quantity evaluated at any position is a constant:
\begin{align}
\Aboxed{P +\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2+ \rho g y=\text{constant}}
\end{align}
This statement is what we call Bernoulli's Equation, and is equivalent to conservation of energy for the fluid. If the fluid is not flowing, then this is equivalent to the statement of hydrostatic equilibrium that we derived in Equation \ref{eq:fluidmechanics:pgrav}:
\begin{align*}
P_1 + \rho g y_1= P_2 + \rho g y_2\\
\therefore P_2 - P_1 = - \rho g (y_2 - y_1)
\end{align*}
If the flow of the fluid is at constant height ($y_2=y_1$), then Bernoulli's equation can be written as:
\begin{align*}
P_1 +\frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 
\end{align*}
If a fluid is flowing at constant height such that $v_2 > v_1$ (as in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:continuous}), then $P_2<P_1$; that is, the \textbf{pressure in the fluid is lower if the fluid is flowing faster}. Note that $P$ is the pressure inside the fluid and is not related to the force that would be exerted by the fluid if it were to collide with an object. It makes sense that the fluid has a lower pressure where it is moving faster, because the net force exerted on the fluid is related to the difference in pressure on either side of the fluid. The fluid will accelerate in the direction where pressure decreases, thus it will be moving faster when it is in a region of low pressure.

Bernoulli's principle can be used to describe many phenomena. For example, an air plane wing (technically, an ``air foil'') creates lift because because the pressure of the air above the wing is lower than the pressure above the wing. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fluidmechanics:airfoil}, which shows that the laminar flow of the air creates a low pressure area above the wing. As the stream lines of air encounter the wing, those that are above the wing get compressed together, which leads to a faster speed of the air above the wing because of the equation of continuity. The resulting difference in air pressure above and below the air foil results in a net upwards force on the wing. This is also the principle that describes how the wind passing by the sail of a sail boat can results in a force on the boat that move the boat upwind.
\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/FluidMechanics/airfoil.png}{\label{fig:fluidmechanics:airfoil}Laminar flow of air around a wing. The path above the wing is longer, so the air moves faster, creating a region of low pressure. }

Bernoulli's principle also describes why the roof can be lifted off a house in high winds. It is not the force of the wind agains the roof that blows the roof off of a house; it is the difference in air pressure in the house (high) and the pressure above the roof (low, due to the flowing wind), the results in a net upwards force on a roof.
